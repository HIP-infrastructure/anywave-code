Qt5

AnyWave uses Qt5 so the first requirement will be that you have Qt5 on your system. The QtCharts module is required.

Other dependencies 
VTK Qwt MATIO Armadillo

Example on Fedora 27 :

dnf install gcc-c++ cmake qt-devel vtk-devel qwt-devel matio-devel qt5-qtcharts-devel vtk-qt armadillo-devel

Ubundu Debian:

apt-get install -y cmake qt-dev libvtk-dev 

- INSTALL using cmake:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..

Install path:

CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX is by default set to /usr/local/AnyWave.
Change it with :
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/my/path ..



Build with qmake
You can also build the application using qmake (you will also build the MATLAB mex files)

cd src
qmake AnyWaveSolution.pro
make 

config.pri  must be modified in order to correclty set the paths to VTK, Armadillo, Matio, Qwt.
